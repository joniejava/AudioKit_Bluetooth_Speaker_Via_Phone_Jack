## ðŸŽ§ AudioKit Bluetooth Speaker â€” Rebirth in Code  

Hi, Iâ€™m John.  

As a kid, I was obsessed with my Amstrad CPC464 â€” Iâ€™d sit there for hours, typing out games line by line, completely lost in the magic of making something come alive on screen. Life took me in other directions: I became a mechanic, gardener, builder, roofer, scaffolder â€” Iâ€™ve worked with my hands all my life.  

Then everything changed. Health caught up with me, and I had to stop the physical graft. It hit hard â€” I felt lost for a while. But what I didnâ€™t realise was that life was *redirecting me*, not ending anything.  

Now, Iâ€™m 49 â€” and Iâ€™ve come full circle.  
Iâ€™m learning C++, Python, Bash, Git, and building things again â€” just in a different way. Iâ€™m creating sound, music, and connection through tech. This project â€” the **ESP32 AudioKit Bluetooth Speaker** â€” is part of that rebirth. Itâ€™s a blend of code, creativity, and heart.  

Because it turns out, I was never done building.  
I just had to switch tools.
