ðŸŽ§ AudioKit Bluetooth Speaker â€” Rebirth in Code

Hi, Iâ€™m John.

As a kid, I was obsessed with my Amstrad CPC464 â€” Iâ€™d sit there for hours, typing out games line by line, completely lost in the magic of making something come alive on screen. Life took me in other directions: I became a mechanic, gardener, builder, roofer, scaffolder â€” Iâ€™ve worked with my hands all my life.

Then everything changed. Health caught up with me, and I had to stop the physical graft. Around the same time, I went through a devastating breakup â€” a manipulative one, filled with financial deceit and lies. I lost not only my savings but, even worse, my two children for now â€” taken from my daily life by greed and bitterness. For two years I cried, trying to understand how someone could twist love into something so cruel.

But one day, my kids will understand. The truth always surfaces. And when it does, theyâ€™ll know their dad never stopped fighting â€” not with anger, but by rebuilding.

Because out of all that pain, I found something I thought Iâ€™d lost â€” myself.
Through tech, sound, and code, I found a way forward. I found purpose again.

Now, at 49, Iâ€™m teaching myself C++, Python, Bash, and Git.
This project â€” the ESP32 AudioKit Bluetooth Speaker â€” is more than just a bit of code and hardware. Itâ€™s proof that you can start again, even from the ruins.

Because I was never finished.
I just had to rebuild with different tools â€” and this time, itâ€™s with purpose, clarity, and hope.
